# Lab 6: National Parks Smart Dashboard

## Description
A dashboard visualizing 2023 visitor statistics for US National Parks.

## Map Type Justification
**Type:** Proportional Symbol Map.
**Reason:** I selected proportional symbols because "Annual Visitors" is a count (magnitude) variable associated with specific point locations. A choropleth map would be inappropriate as it requires coloring entire regions (polygons), whereas parks are distinct points.

## Libraries
* Mapbox GL JS
* C3.js / D3.js
